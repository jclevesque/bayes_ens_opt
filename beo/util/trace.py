def inside_out(results, filter_keys=[], verbose=False):
    '''
    Flips the results array inside out. At first, when output by grid
    search and array grid search, the array is a list of dictionaries
    (sometimes containing more dictionaries). Make this into a dict of
    lists, allowing for easier browsing of the results.

    Parameters:
    -----------

    results: list of dict, as constructed by the function test.grid_search
    (and then reloaded from the files saved)

    Returns:
    --------

    dict_of_lists: a dictionary containing a list of items for each of the keys
     found

    Example:
    --------

    >>> a = [{'x':8,'y':0},{'x':15,'y':20}]
    >>> results_array.inside_out(a)
    {'x': array([ 8, 15]), 'y': array([ 0, 20])}
